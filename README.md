## Attribution

The Apple Script that powers the shortcut's functionality was inspired by reddit post [https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/yp5817/shortcut_for_creating_a_new_hide_my_email_alias/](Shortcut for creating a new Hide My Email alias) by [u/b_leep's](https://www.reddit.com/user/b_leep/)

## Disclaimer

The Apple script uses macOS GUI elements and Apple may introduce breaking changes with newer updates. I will try to keep this up to date with newer macOS versions, but will not be my top priority.
